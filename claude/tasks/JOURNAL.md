# Journal

Append-only handoff notes, one entry per task. This is how a session that ends
survives into the next one — if a session is refreshed or compacted, this file is
what is left.

**Read the last 3 entries at the start of a session. Not the whole file.**

Keep entries under 8 lines. **Notes** record what a future session would otherwise
have to rediscover — a non-obvious decision, a trap you hit — not a summary of the
task file.

Statuses: `DONE` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED`

---

<!-- Example of the shape. Delete this block when the first real entry lands.

## T1.03 — Value noise and fBm — DONE
Files: crates/game-core/src/map/noise.rs, .../map/mod.rs
Verified: `cargo test -p game-core noise` — 9 passed
Notes: fbm normalises by the amplitude sum, not the octave count, so tuning
       NOISE_OCTAVES will not shift SOLID_THRESHOLD's meaning.
Left for later: nothing

## T1.10 — Traversal graph — BLOCKED
Files touched: crates/game-core/src/map/gen/traversal.rs (partial, compiles)
Done: can_walk, can_drop, spatial bucketing
Not done: can_jump arc sampling, can_jetpack, analyse()
Blocker: docs/10-map-generation.md §7b gives the jump envelope but not the arc
         sample spacing for the AABB test. I used 8 px per §7b's prose — needs
         confirming before the component test is meaningful.
Next session: start from can_jump.

## (no entries yet — the project has not been started)

## T0.01 — Cargo workspace and three crate skeletons — DONE
Files: Cargo.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, crates/{game-core,game-server,game-wasm}/
Verified: `cargo build --workspace` OK; `cargo tree -p game-core | grep -c tokio` = 0
Notes: socketioxide 0.18 needs axum 0.8 (not 0.7 as the task file says) — they share
       http 1.x. Deviated to axum 0.8 + socketioxide 0.18. game-core's `serde` and
       `dump-png` are optional features; `default = ["serde"]`.
Left for later: nothing

## T0.02 — constants.rs — DONE
Files: crates/game-core/src/constants.rs, lib.rs
Verified: `cargo test -p game-core constants` — 15 passed
Notes: mirrors docs/02-constants.md AND the v2 amendments (marked section at the
       bottom). Ranges became _MIN/_MAX pairs. ScaleParams gained cave_chambers,
       crevice_count, void_count, bridge_count; blob_count raised to 6/10/15 per v2.
       Tests need #[allow(clippy::assertions_on_constants)] — asserting on consts is
       the point of the file.
Left for later: nothing

## T0.03 — Seeded RNG and sub-streams — DONE
Files: crates/game-core/src/rng.rs, lib.rs
Verified: `cargo test -p game-core rng` — 18 passed
Notes: added range_i32 and a hand-written Fisher-Yates `shuffle` beyond the task's
       list — later passes need both, and rand's own shuffle is not guaranteed
       stable across versions, which would break golden hashes.
       next_round_seed uses the splitmix64 finaliser so consecutive rounds do not
       produce visibly related maps.
Left for later: nothing

## T0.04 — Vec2, Aabb and maths helpers — DONE
Files: crates/game-core/src/math.rs, lib.rs
Verified: `cargo test -p game-core math` — 22 passed
Notes: wrap_to_pi needs a 1e-5 epsilon at the −π boundary. `-3.0*PI` in f32 lands
       ~5e-7 above −2π, so the naive fold returns −π+5e-7 and the documented
       "−3π → π" fails. Documented in the fn. Also added Point (integer, for mask
       space), lerp_angle (shortest arc) and Vec2::distance* beyond the task list.
Left for later: nothing

## T0.05 — Server skeleton — DONE
Files: crates/game-server/src/{main,config,logging,app,state}.rs, lib.rs,
       tests/skeleton.rs, Cargo.toml
Verified: `cargo test -p game-server` — 18 passed (incl. socket.io echo round-trip);
          live `curl /healthz` → {"players":0,"rooms":0,"status":"ok","uptime_s":2}
Notes: DEVIATION — added lib.rs + app.rs + state.rs beyond the task's file list.
       Integration tests need a lib target to build the same router the binary
       serves. Config::from_source takes an injected getter so tests never mutate
       the process env (a race under the threaded runner). Empty FIXED_SEED= means
       unset, not a parse error — compose writes it that way.
Left for later: /metrics is T8.04. rooms/players counters are wired but always 0.
