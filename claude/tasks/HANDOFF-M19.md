# M19 handoff — what is not recoverable from the diff

Written when the T19.01/T19.02 coder was retired at ~690k tokens. Everything here is a
thing the code does not say about itself. The spec is `docs/75-amendments-v7.md`; the
tasks are `tasks/M19/`. This file is the rest.

## Seams, and what must stay in step

- **`weapons/bullet.rs` owns two things.** `muzzle_angle` is the *only* spread draw —
  `Projectiles::spawn` stays RNG-free because the meteor, rain and airburst callers do
  not want a draw. `resolve` is the *only* place a stopped bullet becomes damage or a
  carve.
- **A bullet is not `Burst::Blast`.** `explode` falls off from blast centre to victim
  **centre**, and a body is wider than a pistol's 3 px radius — route a bullet through it
  and every gun deals ~0 damage with every table test still green (§F1, D-62).
- **Four sites decide what a `ProjectileOutcome` means**: `world::detonate`,
  `game-wasm::combat_step`, and two test helpers. All four call `bullet::resolve`. A fifth
  that does not is the fork D-62 is about.
- **`integrate()` in `projectile.rs` is a function only so a test can falsify it.** It
  holds §F1's straight-flight rule. Inline it and the guard becomes unfalsifiable, because
  every shipped bullet already has `gravity_scale`/`wind_scale` of 0.0.
- **`FIRE_CUE` (`GameScene.ts`)** is keyed by weapon **key** through `WEAPON_KEYS`, which
  is pinned to the Rust table. `null` = silent by design (weather); **absent** = a gap,
  and only absent increments `unmappedFireCues`. Exactly the 14 `Projectile`/`Bullet`
  weapons need entries.

## Checks that are timing-sensitive

- **`bullets-visible`**: a screenshot costs ~150 ms, a round crosses the screen in ~475 ms
  at zoom 2. It fires 6 shots and needs >=2 catches. **If it goes flaky, lengthen the
  sampled region — never loosen the movement rule**, which is the only assertion a hitscan
  build cannot pass.
- **`birds`** leads its shot by `dist / SMG_MUZZLE_SPEED`. It was one tick when hitscan
  was instant.
- **`net-smoke`**'s deadline races `LOBBY_BOT_TIMEOUT` (D-59's sibling).
- **`crates`** loses its timing under full-suite load and passes alone (D-59).

## Traps that cost the last agent real time

- **`core.carveCapsule` carves the *client's* mask only.** The server's map is untouched,
  so a round "flying down a carved lane" hits real terrain ~96 px out. Find a clear lane
  with `core.solidAt`; do not make one.
- **Zoom is 2.** An aim point 700 world px away is off-screen, and clamping the mouse
  silently changes the firing angle. Aim ~120 px along the lane.
- `window.__game.debug().drawnProjectiles` is the **drawn** position; the mirror's differs
  (§C7).
- **Absolute brightness is useless where the sky saturates at 255.** Diff per column
  against a control frame, and re-baseline before a control run or craters from earlier
  shots read as signal.
- **The e2e summary prints failures only at the end.** Grepping `FAIL:` mid-run reports 0
  while a check is already red.

## Code that reads wrong and is right

- `a_self_hit_is_reduced_the_same_way_a_blast_is` proves nothing today —
  `SELF_DAMAGE_MULT` is 1.0. The comment says so. It exists so a future non-1.0 value
  cannot land unnoticed. Do not delete it.
- `the_shipped_bullets_fly_flat_through_a_crosswind` **cannot** detect the guard it looks
  like it tests; `the_guard_is_what_keeps_a_bullet_flat_not_the_table` is that test. Both
  are deliberate.
- `LOOK.bullet.r = 2` breaks the `r >= 3` rule on purpose: a bullet's visibility is
  `BULLET_LENGTH`, not its radius.

## Loose ends, standing and unclaimed

- **`game-wasm/src/lib.rs:643`** — the sandbox's *generic* projectile fallback still
  hardcodes a bazooka blast (42 px, 45 damage, `WeaponId(0)`) and hand-derives
  `SelfInflicted` for every non-bullet projectile. Pre-existing, wrong in the same shape
  as the bug T19.01 fixed, deliberately not widened into. **Somebody's next task.**
- **`TRACER_WIDTH` kept its name** while `TRACER_LIFETIME` became `BEAM_LIFETIME`. §F11
  renamed only the one.
- **Bots do not lead a moving target** now that rounds fly. T19.04 re-runs the balance
  harness and should measure it.
- `WEAPON_AIRBURST_PELLET` is still `Hitscan` — nine flying bodies per airburst is what
  `burst_pellets` exists to avoid.
